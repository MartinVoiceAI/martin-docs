## How it works

1. Your co-worker asks for a meeting early next week.
2. You attach martin@trymartin.com and say "find a time for us."
3. Martin checks your calendar and sends a few times on the thread.
4. Co-worker responds to Martin's email "that works."
5. If someone can't make the proposed slot, Martin finds a new time.
6. Once everyone confirms, Martin adds a calendar event on your calendars with a meeting link. Viol√†!
